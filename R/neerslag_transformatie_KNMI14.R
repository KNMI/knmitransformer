# neerslag_transformatie_KNMI14.R    March 10, 2015
#
# author: Alexander Bakker (KNMI)
#
# Function reads 'reference data' with daily precipitation sums [mm] and
#                'change factors' from input files
# and applies them to function 'rr_trans_KNMI14' to obtain
# 'future time series' that match a certain climate
#
# Transformation developed for KNMI'14 climate change scenarios for the Netherlands:

# Bakker, A. (2015), Time series transformation tool: description of the program to generate time series
# consistent with the KNMIâ€™14 climate scenarios, Technical Report TR-349, De Bilt, the Netherlands

#
# arguments:
#
# ifile          Name of the input file (ASCII) that contains reference data (all numerics) in which
#                the columns provide time series for specific stations. The first column
#                should provide either 00000000 or a datestring YYYYMMDD:
#                Rows starting with 00000000 are considered station info (station number, lat, lon
#                etc.) and are ignored.
#                Rows starting with a datestring refer to a specific day in the time series.
#                Rows starting with "#" are completely ignored and returned unchanged
#
# ofile          (DEFAULT="uitvoer.txt") Name of the output file to write the transformed data to.
#                Format is similar to ifile
#
# delta.file     [optional] Name of file that contains deltas (changes factors for the transformation)
#                File should contain following compulsory columns identified with compulsory headers
#                "wdf"       relative change in wet-day frequency
#                            (wet days are defined as days with 0.1 mm or more precipitation)
#                "ave"       relative change in mean precipitation
#                "p99.lower" lower   estimate of the relative change in the 99th percentile of wet-day amounts
#                "p99.centr" central estimate of the relative change in the 99th percentile of wet-day amounts
#                "p99.upper" upper   estimate of the relative change in the 99th percentile of wet-day amounts
#
#                 (If delta.file is not provided, predefined deltas are derived dependening on <sc>, <p> and <scaling>)
#
# sc             scenario                      ["GL", "GH", "WL", "WH"]
# p              time horizon                  [2030 (=DEFAULT), 2050, 2085]
# scaling        scaling extreme precipitation ["lower", "centr" (=DEFAULT), "upper"]
#
# version        "v1.1" [DEFAULT] official version that belongs to KNMI'14
#                "v1.2" alternative procedure to dry wet days
