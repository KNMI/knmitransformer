The 'transformation program' of the KNMI 2014 climate change scenarios for the
Netherlands. With this program current climate time series are transformed to
represent the climate of the KNMI 2014 scenarios for 2030, 2050, and 2085.

The actual transformation procedures for daily meteorological variables are
written in R-code

- 'rr_trans_KNMI14.R'  : precipitation    (sum)                [mm]             
- 'tm_trans_KNMI14.R'  : temperature      (mean, min and max)  [degrees Celsius] 
- 'rsds_trans_KNMI14.R': global radiation (sum)                [kJ/m2]

The R-functions

- 'neerslag_transformatie_KNMI14.R'
- 'temperatuur_transformatie_KNMI14.R'
- 'straling_transformatie_KNMI14.R'
   
are meant to read and transform ASCII files in a format often used by KNMI to
provide data to professional users (see example *.dat files mentioned below).
   
If not provided as argument the  change factors / deltas the official KNMI
deltas are used.
One can inspect the official KNMI14 change factors / deltas in the 
'inst/extData' folder.

<!-- # Examples should be given to users
The following files provide (elemetary) examples how to use above scripts.

- 'example_neerslag_transformatie_KNMI14.R'
- 'example_temperatuur_transformatie_KNMI14.R'
- 'example_straling_transformatie_KNMI14.R'

##
This is IMPORTANT

* Transformation of different time series/stations at once is possible; stations
  should be separated as columns in the inputfile 
* GLOBAL RADIATION input should be in kJ/m2 and not in J/cm2 (the difference is
  a factor 10)
* GLOBAL RADIATION needs "latitude" as input; and this should be provided (for
  each station/column) in the fifth line in de header of the input file.
* TEMPERATURE distinguishes between minimum temperature (tn), mean temperature
  (tg) and maximum temperature (tx); this should be specified in the function
  call
* TEMPERATURE needs the "station number" as input; and this should be provided
  (for each station/column) in the first line in de header of the input file the
  "station number" is used by the TP to select the 'deltas' for the
  corresponding "region" in the Netherlands and uses for this the file
  "stationtabel" (which is included in 'inst/extdata').
  "stationtabel" currently contains 25 different stations which are listed by
  their official station number. 
  ALWAYS CHECK if the station that you want to transform is listed in
  "stationtabel", if not you have to (edit this file and) ADD it.
* For PRECIPITATION for each scenario there are three different transformations
  available, based on resp. the 'lower', 'centr' (=central) and 'upper' estimate 
  of the change in extreme daily precipitation. This should be specified in the
  function call, the default is set to 'centr'.
