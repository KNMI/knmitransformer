knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation
- Usability
- Version control
- Regression testing
- Documentation
- Upcoming climate scenarios or other projects 
- Maintenance?

## Trigger
- Project transformed timeseries for Deltares and RWS by Raymond Sluiter and Jules Beersma for transforming new data again.
- Knmitransformer was removed from knmi account for technical reasons.

## People
The following people should get involved:

- Geert Jan van Oldenborgh
- Jules Beersma
- Janette Bessembinder
- assign technical issues to a thrid person... (suggested by Ge)

## Deliverables
- Unified functionality
- FORTRAN call to R package for website
- Regression testing
- Recalculation of the KNMI14 (revised) indices
- Research on method

## Outlook
1. Collection of data (Christiana or maybe someone else also?) (ready under version control): Days ...
- reference data 1981-2010 (102 stations)
- deltas
- transformed data and validation using knmi14 scenarios version '15

2. Manual regression test (Christiana & Martin): Days...
- code and reference data should be the same as the trasformed data
- indices = scenarios
- ref data...mmm unclear

3. Switch to function and automatic regression tests (Martin and Christiana): Days 3 each 
- put deltas in an internal structure. In case deltas are changed then they should be updated by the one who calculates them (Jules?).
- replace source commands
- test De Bilt: for all variables, all scenarios (check delta files directly). 
- indices calculations for the above selection. check functions of indices.

4. Fix appearence to user and output format (Martin & Christiana): Days 4 each
- wrapping function in fortran

5. Fortran call to this package and webpage launch (Martin & Christiana): Days 5 each 


## TODO-ISSUES
- A4 proposal
- Time estimate
- Who is responisble for Fog, Wind, and Humidity?
- Try to delay the RWS/Deltares project to let them profit from this as well. Since it is financed by RWS it should be finished within 2016.
- Who is responsible for maintenance?
