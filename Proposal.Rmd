```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation

- Usability
- Version control
- Regression testing
- Documentation
- Upcoming climate scenarios

## Trigger
Project by Raymond (and different project by Jules?) for transforming new data again 

## People
The following people should get involved:

- Geert-Jan
- Jules
- Janette

Mention that knmitransformer was removed from knmi account for technical reasons.

## Deliverables

- Unified functionality
- FORTRAN call to R package for website
- Regression testing
- Recalculation of the KNMI14 (revised) indices

## Outlook
Research on method

## TODO

- Time estimate
- Try to delay the RWS/Deltares project to let them profit from this as well
