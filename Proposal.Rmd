```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation
- Usability
- Version control
- Regression testing
- Documentation
- Upcoming climate scenarios or other projects 
- Maintenance?

## Trigger
- Project transformed timeseries for Deltares and RWS by Raymond Sluiter and Jules Beersma for transforming new data again.
- Different scripts in use ...

## People
The following people should get involved:

- Geert Jan van Oldenborgh
- Jules Beersma
- Janette Bessembinder
- assign technical issues to a thrid person... (suggested by Ge)

## Deliverables
- Unified functionality
- FORTRAN call to R package for website
- Regression testing
- Recalculation of the KNMI14 (revised) indices
- Research on method
- Flowchart :)
- Delta calculation is not a part of this package 

## Outlook
1. Collection of data (Christiana or maybe someone else also?) (ready under version control): Days ...
- reference data 1981-2010 (102 stations)
- deltas
- transformed data and validation using knmi14 scenarios version '15

1. Manual regression test (Christiana & Martin): Days...
- code and reference data should be the same as the transformed data
- deltas should be the same
- indices = scenarios

2. Switch to package structure and use automatic regression tests (Martin and Christiana): Days 5 each 
- put deltas in an internal structure. 
- replace source commands
- test De Bilt: for all variables, all scenarios 
- indices calculations for the above selection. check functions of indices.

FIRST MILESTONE

3. Fix appearence to user and output format (Martin (6) Christiana (6), Geert Jan, Rudmer, Janette, Jules)
- tidy input data
- one common function?
- wrapping function in fortran
- User testing (Rudmer?, Janette?)
- MetaData

4. Fortran call to this package and webpage launch (Martin & Christiana): Days 5 each 

SECOND MILESTONE

5. Extend basis version
- longer time series (Rudmer?)
- interpolating time range e.g. 2075 (Geert Jan?)

## TODO-ISSUES
- A4 proposal
- Time estimate
- Who is responsible for Fog, Wind, and Humidity?
- Try to delay the RWS/Deltares project to let them profit from this as well. Since it is financed by RWS it should be finished within 2016.
- Who is responsible for maintenance? 
- Who is responsible for deltas?
