The KNMI climate change scenarios have gained a great deal of reputation not only in the Netherlands but also abroad. 
Since their first edition in 2006 a new version was required to translate the findings of the IPCC report (2013) to the Netherlands. 
For the delivery of the KNMI14 scenarios a necessary update of the code resulted -together with moving staff- in having multiple versions of the transformation code. 
Today, there is no unified version and a responsible team to support it. 
Furthermore, we are moving into a user-friendly oriented climate services where we should be able to provide to the potential user an open source package of the transformation code. 

With this project we propose to develop an open source R-package of the KNMI scenario transformation with unified functionality.
The basic version of the proposed package will be validated such that it can be used to reproduce the KNMI14 (revised ‘15) scenarios (except for wind, humidity and fog).
The unified functionality of the package together with the automated regression testing will allow us to update and maintain efficiently future versions.
The R-package (library) will be distributed through the KNMI github account, where potential users, both inside and outside KNMI, will be able to use the package for individual use and projects.
For the web application, a Fortran wrap will be used to call the R package.
The output format (timeseries, dates, station id, etc) of the package will be decided within the team, following feedback from the expert users within KNMI.
At this stage no visualization of the results will be discussed, as this package focus on the transformation of the data.
A detailed documentation with a flowchart of the functionality of the package will be available together with the package itself. 
Finally, the benefits of the developed R-package will be, hopefully, demonstrated in the upcoming calculations for the future KNMI scenarios. 

The following people are invited to participate:

- Christiana Photiadou (development, project coordination)
- Martin Roth (development, project coordination)
- Geert Jan van Oldenborgh ( development)
- Jules Beersma (development)
- Janette Bessembinder (communication)
- Rudmer Jilderda (development)


#### A work package description follows with detailed steps and milestones:

1.  -Prepare for version controlled development (Time: 20-25 days[^1]):Set up the base version in git repository. This is constructed in the first phase with the goal to recalculate the KNMI14 (version ‘15) indices. This is a validation step which allows us to be sure that we have exactly the same input/output in order to recalculate separate indices if needed.
        * Collection of data: All data necessary for calculation of the scenarios (temperature, precipitation, global radiation) are gathered. 
        * reference data 1981-2010: 102 stations for precipitation, temperature and rest?
        * deltas for all scenarios and time horizons (2030,2050,2085). The deltas are separated from data and remain the same in this project. Update of deltas should not interfere with the functionality of the package.
        * two version of precipitation (v1.1, v1.2). Version 1.2 treads wet/dry days differently that v1.1. In the basic package version v1.1 is used as validation and issues concerning v1.2 is moved to the soundboard for further investigation.
        * rounding step for the brochure. This step is not included in the validation procedure but is moved to the soundboard.
    - Manual regression test
    Here a regression test is performed to guarantee that the developed basic version  produces the same results as KNMI14(‘15). 
        * processed reference data should be the same as the reference data out from KDC
        * deltas should be the same
        * new indices = reference indices

2. Switch to package structure and use automatic regression tests (Time: 13 days)
    - Internal structure for the deltas 
    - test De Bilt: for all variables, all scenarios
    - Calculation of the indices for the above selection. Corresponding version of index functions will be documented.
    - Profiling performance and remove of bottlenecks, multiple stations/grids 

##### FIRST MILESTONE
This basic version of the package can be used for the reproduction of the KNMI14 indices

3. Communication: Fix appearance to user and output format (Time: 20 days)  
Contribution from Geert Jan, Rudmer, Janette, Jules etc
    - agree on one general function be used or a function per variable (temp, precip, etc).  The different transformation procedure of temperature and precipitation will not be visible to the user but it will be to the developer and does not affect the choice of one general function.
    - Wrapping function in fortran to be able to use the R package in climate explorer and the visualization page. 
    - User testing by Rudmer and Janette. The potential user should be in position to retrieve own results.
    - Fix output and input format (tidy data) 
    - Include metadata
    - The team has to agree on the functionality of the package
    - Further internal changes of the package functionality should and will not affect potential users after release. 

4. Outreach web application (Time: 15 days)
    - shiny app 
    - Fortran call for climate explorer


##### SECOND MILESTONE
Use of the same version locally and online. Feedback from the users and potential improvements on the functionality are documented. 


5. Sounding board/ Extend basic version: Up to now we only want to be able to reproduce the KNMI14 indices. Therefore, we restrict the possibilities of the base package. On the other side we are doing this under version control, laying thus the foundation for a controlled development. In one repository there can be different versions. However adding features to the master repository will be first addressed in the sounding board and tested in a developed version. The sound part is therefore intended for the team to write ideas/wishes of exploring once the R package is released. The ideas could be implemented through internships or further internal projects but all of them under version control. 
    - Rudmer: longer time series, changes Rudmer made and now runs for the Deltares project.
    - Geert Jan: interpolating time range e.g. 2075?
    - rounding for brochure
    - Janette: interest in spatial correlations prior/past transformation between stations, and also correlations with gridded precipitation data
    -Janette: look/test alternative ways of drying/wetting days (Alexander Bakker proposed that version 1.2 could be better, but no time was invested to actually test this version)
    -Janette: method for trasnforming hourly precipitation data (consistency with daily precipitation).
    -Janette: include transformation programmes for humidity and wind speed (although changes are not significant).
